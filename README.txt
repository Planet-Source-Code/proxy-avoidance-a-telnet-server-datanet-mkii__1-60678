If you read the User Manual, you will find out
that the DataNet appliction does not actually
contain any commands that users can process
when connected to the server. DataNet's command
library runs off 'plugin DLLs'.
So, you must first open up each of the 'Plugin'
projects (located in the MODULES dir) and
compile the DLL for each of these 2 plugins.
Once these are compiles, DataNet has already been
setup to detect them. So..
1) Compile the DLLs for each of the Plugins (two of them)
2) Run DataNet
3) Refer to the User Manual to work out how to use it

I ahve already setup the server with example domains
and user accounts to get you started!

For those who like the program, and want to use it
in compiled form, it would probably be easier
just to download the Setup.Exe for it from my site:

NOTE: The Generation 1 plugin is not finished yet,
I have half made an internal e-mail command for it
